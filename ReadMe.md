# JuicyGUI



GUI-Library for SDL2.0, written in C++



## Installation

This library has been superceded by [ZDK](https://github.com/ZaidaTek/ZDK), and is now deprecated, and no longer maintained.

It's presence here is intended solely for illustrative purposes.



## JuicyConway

An implementation of JuicyGUI can be observed in JuicyConway.

A fully compiled version for Windows can be found [here](https://github.com/ariebesehl/JuicyGUI/raw/master/JuicyConway/__latest.zip).



## Test_JENWIN

To eliminate external dependency of SDL2.0, a version of JuicyGUI was being developed that interfaces directly with the WIN32 API.

A fully compiled version can be found [here](https://github.com/ariebesehl/JuicyGUI/raw/master/Test_JENWIN/__latest.zip).

Development of C++-based JuicyGUI/JENWIN was then abandoned in favor of pursuing a purely C-based library, with parts of its code reused and recycled into its successor, [ZDK](https://github.com/ZaidaTek/ZDK), instead.
